# The multiplier design files are meant to get accustomed to Verilog coding and how multipliers work at a lower level, as well as expanding the knowledge of sequential versus combinational logic through programming in the Vivado environment, and many instantiations to familiarize the modular approach.
# The multiplier test bench is the corresponding tb.v file meant to practice binary testing for the design.v modules.

# The constraints were mapped where the input number bits were switches and the input clock was provided by the board (ended up having delay cycles refresh_counter for extended clock cycles), and the output mapped to the seven segment display.
